Good morning everybody, my name is Gavin...
If anybody actually knows what "Digital Transformation" actually means, would you mind catching up with me afterwards, it's been in my job title at least once if not twice and I'm still not fully clear on this.

Anyway, I got the idea for this talk from a fairly well known "inspirational" poem, which starts like this:
# 2

Start where you stand and never mind the past,
The past won't help you in beginning new,
If you have left it all behind at last
Why, that's enough, you're done with it, you're through;

So this is about transformation, and transformation means
# 3
**Consultants**
Now, if you're a DevOps consultancy and you're sponsoring this event, naturally this isn't about you, it's about the consultancies that do things like this
# 4
Now, there are a couple of warning signs in this picture. The most obvious one is that the meeting starts at 12 o'clock. Some of you in the audience might be thinking that I made this up, that this never happened, but sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.
 # 5
 So here's the mandatory reference to Conway's law, and the reason it's here is to emphasise that DevOps is all about a revolutionary Enterprise wide culture shift

 # 6 

 and tearing up the Organisational chart in favour of Squads, Chapters, Tribes and Guilds...
 but not tearing up the Gantt chart, we charged the client 30 grand for that Gantt chart.

 # 7

 In the end, this story always ends in the same way, with the consultant sailing off into the sunset whilst the Enterprise DevOps transformation is dashed on the rocks of despair.

 # 8 

 But what if we, here, could start from where we sit? In the cubicle rather than in the boardroom? How does this change the story? Well, I've got another inspirational quotation, this time from Admiral Grace Hopper, which is to say that 
 
 # 9 
 "it is easier to apologise than to ask permission"
 Grace Hopper, of course was the inventor of the compiler, so if it wasn't for her we wouldn't be sitting here, we'd be out doing proper jobs like sheep shearing or basket-weaving.

 # 10

 So what happens when we apologise rather than asking permission?
 
  But, Grace Hopper wasn't working at Spotify, she was working at Remington Rand corporation in the 1950s, and it didn't end all that badly. So how do we avoid the dreaded pink slip?

 # 11

 Well, one way might be to reduce the "Blast Radius", which is a term used in a variety of contexts to mean "the amount of things that can break as a result of any given change", so we reduce the blast radius by making small changes.

 # 12

 So, in the context of making small changes, how can we go about acting out the "Three Ways", which will be familiar to most of you from the Phoenix project; Creating a fast flow of work, shortening feedback loops, and fostering a culture of experimentation

 # 13

 We increase flow by removing bottlenecks. Even if we don't have automation in the datacentre, who's to say we can't have it on the desktop. Even if we have to have the useless Gantt chart, it doesn't mean we can't use other tools to keep our own batch size small.

 # 14

 And what about feedback? Did anyone here ever get in trouble with the boss for writing too many tests? And the tools are out there, right? And do we really need to ask permission to stop passing defects downstream?

 # 15

 Is this harder? Well maybe we can start by stopping the blame game, by making it OK to slip up, by being better people. How much does that cost? Or what about making our services better instrumented, so we can figure out what we might want to change.

 # 16

 And where do these changes lead? Well, they lead to recognition in the workplace, and they lead to other individuals and teams wanting to copy what the successful individuals and teams are doing.

 #17

 Another way to think about this is that the evidence of success will allow us to build up this thing called "political capital",
