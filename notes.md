Er...
If anybody here knows what "Digital Transformation" actually refers to, it would be great if you have time to fill me in on this afterwards, it's been in my job title at least once if not twice and it's still not really  clear.

Anyway, I got the idea for this talk from a fairly well known "inspirational" poem, which starts like this:
# 2

Start where you stand and never mind the past,
The past won't help you in beginning new,
If you have left it all behind at last
Why, that's enough, you're done with it, you're through;

So this is about renewal, and transformation, and transformation means
# 3 ++
**Consultants**
Now, if you're a DevOps consultancy and you're sponsoring this event, obviously this isn't about you, it's about those other consultancies - and we all know who I mean -  that do things like this
# 4
Now, there are a couple of warning signs in this picture. The most obvious one is that the meeting starts at 12 o'clock. Who does that, right?  I can see some people down here who think I made this up, that this never happened, but sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.
 # 5
 In any DevOps talk there's a rule that you have to have a reference to Conway's law, and the reason it's here is to emphasise that DevOps is all about a revolutionary Enterprise wide culture shift, realigning our corporate structure to reflect the containerised, serverless microservices we had in our BPMN diagram

 # 6 

 and tearing up the Organisational chart in favour of Squads, Chapters, Tribes and Guilds, because we read online that Spotify do that, so it's entirely appropriate for our buggy whip and horse brass company.
 
 But not tearing up the Gantt chart, we charged the client 30 grand for that Gantt chart.

 # 7

 In the end, this story always ends in the same way, with the consultant sailing off into the sunset whilst the Enterprise DevOps transformation is dashed on the rocks of despair.

 But what if there were another way? A way we could follow all by ourselves, given the resources already at our disposal?

 # 8 

 What if we, here, could start from where we sit? In the cubicle rather than at the Agile Management Retreat?  What can we do, from where we  sit,  to make things better?
 
 Well, I've got another  quotation, this time from Admiral Grace Hopper, which goes like this
 
 # 9 
 "it is easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission"
 Grace Hopper, of course was the inventor of the compiler, so if it wasn't for her we wouldn't be sitting here, we'd be out doing proper jobs like sheep shearing or basket-weaving.

 # 10

 So what happens when we ask forgiveness rather than getting permission?
 
 I know, right. But does it really have to end like that?
 
  Grace Hopper wasn't working at Spotify, she was in the Navy, working at Remington Rand corporation in the 1950s, and it didn't end all that badly. So how do we avoid the dreaded pink slip?

 # 11

 Well, one way might be to reduce the "Blast Radius", which is a term used in a variety of contexts to mean "the amount of things that can break as a result of any given change", so we reduce the blast radius by making small changes in a manner that we can control.

 # 12

 So, in the context of making small changes, how can we go about acting out the "Three Ways", which will be familiar to most of you from the Phoenix project; Creating a fast flow of work, shortening feedback loops, and fostering a culture of experimentation and

 # 13

 We increase flow by removing bottlenecks. 
 
 Even if we don't have automation in the datacentre, who's to say we can't have it on the desktop, so we have at least one environment managed in a sane, repeatable way. 
 
 Even if we have to have the 24-month Gantt chart, it doesn't mean we can't use other tools to make our own work manageable.

 # 14

 And what about feedback? Did anyone here ever get in trouble with the boss for writing too many tests? And the tools are out there, right? And do we really need to ask permission to stop passing defects downstream?

 # 15

 Is this harder? Well maybe we can start by stopping the blame game, by making it OK to slip up, by being better people. How much does that cost? Or what about making our services better instrumented, so we can figure out what we might want to change. Does that require an enterprise culture shift?

 # 16

 In my experience, even if the "higher ups" are too busy filling in their RACI diagrams to notice what you've been up to at 360-degree review time, the other teams around you _will_ notice. And after noticing, they will start to do some of the same things, to model their own behaviours on yours.

 # 17

 Another way to think about this is that the process of doing the right thing leads to tbe accrual of "political capital", which is a metaphor, really, that encapsulates these notions of reputation, trust, goodwill, influence, and all the other things that derive from good behaviour.

 # 18

 But why? Well, the reason we want to have any kind of capital is to spend it on doing the right thing. In the case of the political capital we generate by starting from where we sit, the right thing probably looks like influencing working practices ... or helping others ... or even transforming the working environment

# 19

to make things better for ourselves. Really, who cares about the Enterprise Culture shift if we can make our own working lives less awful by doing a few simple things in the right way.

# 20

The world won't care about your old defeats
If you can start anew and win success.
The future is your time and time is fleet
And there is much of work and strain and stress.
